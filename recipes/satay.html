    <h3>Grilled chicken skewers marinated with spices and served with peanut sauce.</h3>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large red onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 large garlic cloves, chopped</li>
        <li>3 stalks lemon grass, chopped</li>
        <li>½ cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon peanut oil</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon ground turmeric</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons brown sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground cumin</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
        <li>salt and black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - pounded thin</li>
        <li>12 wooden or bamboo skewers</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Preparation</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large nonreactive bowl, stir together the onion, garlic, lemon grass, soy sauce, peanut oil, turmeric, brown sugar, cumin, ginger, salt, and pepper. Reserve about 2 tablespoons of marinade in a small bowl, and refrigerate until cooking time. Mix the chicken breasts into the remaining marinade, stir to coat well, and marinate in refrigerator overnight.</li>
        <li>About 30 minutes before serving, soak the skewers in water. Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil the grate.</li>
        <li>Remove the chicken breasts from the bowl, and discard the used marinade. Cut each chicken breast on the diagonal into 6 long strips, and thread a chicken strip onto one of the soaked skewers. Grill the skewers, turning frequently and basting with the reserved marinade, until the chicken is cooked through with brown, crispy edges, 5 to 8 minutes per skewer.</li>
    </ol>
