This is Project Odin Recipe

I am tasked to build a simple website showcasing a few recipes with different links and images. I will be using HTML to build this.

This project will require me to utilize different techniques taught through the HTML foundation lessons on Odin Project, including but not limited to:
    - Use of elements and tags
    - HTML Boilerplate
    - List
    - Links and Images
    - Commit Messages
